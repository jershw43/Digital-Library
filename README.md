# Digital-Library
This is the project repository for the Digital Library senior project. The Digital Library is a web and mobile based application that allows users to scan or enter books into a personalized library. In addition to the digital bookshelf, the Digital Library provides AI reccommendations based on the books in a user's bookshelf.
